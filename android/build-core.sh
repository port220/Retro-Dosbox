# Two things this deliberately does NOT do, both of which the previous
# Retro-Dosbox Android build did and paid for:
#
#  1. It does not borrow prebuilt SDL/libpng out of a retired app's source
#     tree. That made the build unreproducible on any other machine and
#     impossible in CI. SDL3 is built from source here.
#  2. It does not share a configured tree with the host build. Autotools trees
#     are single-config: an Android ./configure over a host tree leaves stale
#     objects that link with "incompatible with aarch64linux", or silently
#     compiles host sources with the NDK compiler.

# 1b. Port220 serial backend

# The core is a submodule, so its sources are not ours to edit in git. The
# backend is injected into the staged tree instead, which keeps the fork's
# diff against upstream in one place (core-patch/) and means no second fork
# to maintain.
#
# Why a backend at all: DOSBox-X's `nullmodem` lives behind #if C_MODEM, and
# C_MODEM requires SDL_net, which is switched off below (--disable-sdlnet).
# With it off, serialport.cpp does not recognise the string "nullmodem" and a
# [serial] line naming it is silently ignored -- the failure mode is a clean
# launch with no connection and no error anywhere. port220serial.cpp uses
# plain POSIX sockets, so it needs no SDL_net and cannot break on SDL version
# skew.
#
# Every step below is checked. A silently skipped patch here would produce a
# core that builds, runs, and cannot talk to the bridge.

# The engine is pulled in WHOLE: nothing in the host API references most of
# DOSBox-X directly -- the mainloop pulls it in at runtime -- so without
# --whole-archive the linker would discard almost the entire emulator.
#
# The archive list comes from make expanding dosbox_x_LDADD, not from a glob:
# a glob over src/*/lib*.a silently misses the nested ones (libs/gui_tk,
# hardware/mame, hardware/reSID) and the failure only appears at dlopen as an
# undefined symbol. LDADD also repeats libgui.a, which is harmless normally
# but is a duplicate-symbol error under --whole-archive, so it is deduped.
# -lz because the engine uses zlib (zipfile, ZMBV) and configure only adds it
# when its own probe finds it, which a cross build may not.
#
# -Wl,--no-undefined is the important one. A shared library links happily with
# unresolved symbols by default, so a missing -l shows up on the DEVICE as
#   dlopen failed: cannot locate symbol "inflateInit2_"
# and the app dies instantly with no crash and no stack. Failing the LINK
# instead turns a device-only mystery into a build error naming the symbol.
