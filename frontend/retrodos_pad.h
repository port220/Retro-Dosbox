/*
 * retro-dosbox — virtual pad: on-screen controls and physical gamepads.
 *
 * Both input sources feed ONE button state here, and everything downstream
 * reads only that. A DOS game cannot tell whether Left came from a thumb on
 * glass or from a stick, and neither should the rest of the frontend -- the
 * alternative is two parallel mapping paths that drift apart.
 *
 * What the buttons DO is deliberately not fixed. Most DOS games are keyboard
 * games: Descent, Doom and Commander Keen all want arrows and Ctrl/Alt, not a
 * stick. So each virtual button carries a scancode, and the emulated game port
 * is driven as well only when asked for. Bindings are settings, per game.
 *
 * Positions are fractions of the screen rather than pixels. A phone, a handheld
 * and a tablet have very different screens, and a pixel layout that suits one
 * is off the edge of another -- rotating the device would move every control.
 * Fractions survive all of it.
