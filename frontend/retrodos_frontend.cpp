/*
 * retro-dosbox frontend — SDL3 + Dear ImGui.
 *
 * This owns the window. The engine runs HEADLESS behind it through the Game
 * Link output and hands us finished frames via the retrodos_host framebuffer
 * tap. That arrangement buys three things at once:
 *
 *   - DOSBox-X's own menu bar and config GUI never appear, because there is no
 *     DOSBox-X window for them to be drawn into.
 *   - The DOS picture is SCALED. With --disable-opengl the engine's only
 *     on-screen backend is `surface`, which blits 1:1 and leaves a 720x400
 *     picture in the corner of a 1920x1080 handheld.
 *   - There is somewhere to put a wizard, a library and a keyboard, which an
 *     emulator that boots straight into DOS has nowhere to host.
 *
 * Two threads: the engine thread runs the blocking DOSBox-X mainloop; this one
 * does SDL, ImGui and the frame blit. Everything sent to the engine goes
 * through retrodos_host_*, which queues rather than touching emulator state.
